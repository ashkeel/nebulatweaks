# McKarty's server tweaks are bullshit blazing

Hello casual snooper

## What's this

This is basically mod for mods! It messes with the mods lua vars and things like that to modify things that are not exposed via cvars (for non-reusable mods at least)

Currently in:

- Removes Ring Runner and Chaos Ring Runners, the two universally hated battle modes in the server.
- Disabling Juicebox gates in specific maps because sometimes you *really* don't want that boost.

Experimenting with:

- A BattlePlus mode ~~ripping off~~ *inspired* by [Teamkill](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730020/Teamkill/)

Soon?

- Random race mutators

## Ok but why?

A lot of mods nowadays are not reusable and that pisses me off! If I can't modify the PK3 themselves, I'm going to patch them out later, even if it's done in a horrible and disgusting way! 

I will apologize to all my fellow players who have their client go left and right, but I will not apologize to mod creators for making their copyright-stealing shit non-reusable.

## Can i modify this?

Please feel free to! All I ask if that you change the name, I called it `xl_nebulatweaks*.pk3` as it applies to my server (nebula.cafe).

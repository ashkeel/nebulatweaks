# McKarty's server tweaks are bullshit blazing

Hello casual snooper

## What's this

This is basically mod for mods! It messes with the mods lua vars and things like that to modify things that are not exposed via cvars (for non-reusable mods and to minimize forks)

Currently in:

- Disabling Juicebox gates in specific maps because sometimes you _really_ don't want that boost.
- Saying "HELL" during map voting will call for a vote to go to a random hell map

Soon?

- Random race mutators

Removed:

- Removes Ring Runner and Chaos Ring Runners, the two universally hated battle modes in the server. (Removed in v3.2)
- Incomplete TeamKill mode (Removed in v3.2)

## Can I modify this?

Please feel free to! All I ask if that you change the name, I called it `xl_nebulatweaks*.pk3` as it applies to my server (nebula.cafe).
